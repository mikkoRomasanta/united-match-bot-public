This is a personal project for our discord server. The main purpose of the bot is to inform us of
upcoming Manchester United games.

It is written in Python3.8 and hosted on a free AWS server.

I might continue to update and add features to the bot if we find it necessary.

I haven't set this up to be an app so you would have to download the following dependecies:

pip3 install google-api-python-client
pip3 install google_auth_oauthlib
pip3 install -U discord.py
pip3 install -U python-dotenv
